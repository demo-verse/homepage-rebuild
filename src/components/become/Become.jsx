                    broader sense, web3, has been the first tool we're using for
                    this purpose: to experience and share rights, along with
                    resources.
                    <br></br> <br></br>
                    We humbly want to start something we call, Peace Economy and
                    its incentives without asking for permission. We got that
                    permission already, by the living and the future generations
