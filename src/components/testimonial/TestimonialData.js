I want to live in a world filled with the energy of #mutualism as opposed to c[r]apitalism and consumerism. I want to save the planet from destruction and GrandMother Moon from colonization.',

Hoping that peace and trust making in the 21st century will be perceived and experienced as: a small step for each of us and a big one for humanity. Peace, is just the start. Let\'s live and leave that as a legacy with our Art of Peace, and focus on healing this planet and those living on it. I believe in the greatness of humanity; and I need, and want humanity to believe in itself too.',
