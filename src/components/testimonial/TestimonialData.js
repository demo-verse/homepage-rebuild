I want to live in a world filled with the energy of #mutualism as opposed to c[r]apitalism and consumerism. I want to save the planet from destruction and GrandMother Moon from colonization.',

Everyday there is a new problem that needs to be solved and by using Expressions of Peace, it helps me come up with peaceful and better ways to solve problems that occur in my life.

Hoping that peace and trust making in the 21st century will be perceived exactly: a small step for each of us and a big one for humanity. Peace, is just the start. Let\'s live and leave that as a legacy with our Art of Peace, and focus on healing this planet and those living on it. I believe in humanity, and I need, and want humanity to believe in itself too.',
