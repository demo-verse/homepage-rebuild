Have found great motivation on working for this cause since late January, and am happy to gift a project like this, and connecting with people that are caring, aware, generous, and wanted some good, scalable change and impact. I am hopeful, that everyone experiences that, peacemaking in the 21st century will be a small step for each of us and a big leap for humanity. Peace, is just the start. Let\'s live and leave that as a legacy with our Art of Peace, and focus on healing this planet and those living on it.',
